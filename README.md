# Math Requirements for ML Concepts

## **Calculus 1**
### **1. Derivatives (Differentiation):**
- **Definition:** Understanding limits and how derivatives represent the rate of change.
- **Rules of Differentiation:**
  - **Power Rule:** 
  - **Sum and Difference Rules.**
  - **Constant Multiple Rule.**
- **Applications:** Slope of curves, optimization problems.

### **2. Chain Rule:**
- **Use:** Differentiating composite functions

### **3. Product Rule:**
- **Use:** Differentiating products of functions.

---

## **Linear Algebra**
### **1. Matrix Operations:**
- **Addition, Subtraction, and Scalar Multiplication.**
- **Matrix Multiplication:** Understanding dimensions and the dot product.
- **Transpose of a Matrix.**
- **Inverse of a Matrix** (when it exists).

### **2. Vectors:**
- **Basics:** Magnitude and direction.
- **Dot Product** 
- **Cross Product** (optional): Useful for 3D vector calculations.
- **Applications:** Linear transformations and projections.

---

## **Probability and Statistics**
### **1. Measures of Central Tendency:**
- **Mean:** \( \mu = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} \).
- **Median:** Middle value in sorted data.
- **Mode:** Most frequent value in the dataset.

### **2. Measures of Dispersion:**
- **Standard Deviation:** \( \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}} \).
- **Variance:** \( \sigma^2 \), square of standard deviation.

### **3. Z-Score:**
- **Formula:** \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \).
- **Use:** Measuring how far a data point is from the mean in standard deviations.
