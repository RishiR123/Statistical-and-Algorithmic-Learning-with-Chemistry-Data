# Statistical and Algorithmic Learning with Chemistry Data

Welcome to the private repository for the **Statistical and Algorithmic Learning with Chemistry Data** course! This repository contains all the resources, plans, and meeting links for the 15-day learning journey.

## Course Overview
This course focuses on understanding statistical concepts and implementing machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn. The context is rooted in chemistry data, ensuring practical and domain-relevant learning.

## Schedule
### 15-Day Learning Plan
| Day        | Topic                          | Description                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1-2    | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)| Analyze pH, solubility, and other properties. Learn mean, median, mode, etc.|
| Day 3      | Z-Scores and Outlier Detection | Identify and handle outliers using z-scores. Discuss their impact in chemistry. |
| Day 4      | Machine Learning , Deep Learning and NLP Ralations and Essentials|
| Day 5-6    | Linear Regression              | Predict solubility using pH and density. Implement with scikit-learn.       |
| Day 7-8    | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)      | Classify samples as acidic or basic. Focus on hyperparameters and accuracy. |
| Day 9-10   | K-Means Clustering             | Group samples by properties like solubility and conductivity. Visualize clusters. |
| Day 11-12  | Decision Trees                 | Predict reaction types (Exothermic/Endothermic). Learn feature importance.  |
| Day 13-14  | Gradient Descent               | Understand optimization and cost functions in ML.                           |
| Day 15     | Capstone Project               | Apply all techniques to analyze and present insights from the dataset.      |
