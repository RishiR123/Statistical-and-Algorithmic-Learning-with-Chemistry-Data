## Schedule
### 15-Day Learning Plan
| Day        | Topic                          | Description                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Day 1-2    | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)| Analyze pH, solubility, and other properties. Learn mean, median, mode, etc.|
| Day 3      | Z-Scores and Outlier Detection | Identify and handle outliers using z-scores. Discuss their impact in chemistry. |
| Day 4      | Linear Regression              | Predict solubility using pH and density. Implement with scikit-learn.       |
| Day 5-6    | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)      | Classify samples as acidic or basic. Focus on hyperparameters and accuracy. |
| Day 7-8    | K-Means Clustering             | Group samples by properties like solubility and conductivity. Visualize clusters. |
| Day 9-10   | Decision Trees                 | Predict reaction types (Exothermic/Endothermic). Learn feature importance.  |
| Day 11     | Gradient Descent               | Understand optimization and cost functions in ML.                           |
| Day 12     | Project No 1                   | Student has to do both EDA and Prediction on any Algorithm on their choice  |
| Day 13-14  | Project No 2                   | Student has to do a full Data Research , EDA , Prediction and Deployment    |
| Day 15+    | Capstone Project               | Apply all techniques to create a industry standard model                    |
